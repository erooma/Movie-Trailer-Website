Flixnet: All your favorite movie trailers! (version 1.0).

These files are a means of cataloging and displaying your favorite movies, with easy click on access to trailers and movie information.
Simply run the file entertainment_center.py in a python-run environment and this will render your web page, Flixnet.

To see specific trailers or movie information, hover over each movie poster with the mouse and choose the appropriate button.
To search for a movie, simply type the name exactly (including capital letters) into the search box.

The files in this build include:

1. content.py : houses the content including movie poster and you-tube trailer URL's.
2. entertainment_center.py: imports the content and runs the build
3. flixnet.py: the main file to render the content and web page
4. media.py: the class definition file for movie information

*flixnet.py is a modified version of fresh_tomatoes (Udacity)
*FLIXNET brand is a modified logo from NETFLIX. Not for professional release.
